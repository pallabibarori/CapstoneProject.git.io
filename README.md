## CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION

### 1.1 Objective
The retail industry heavily relies on Market Basket Analysis (MBA) to understand customer preferences and drive sales. This project aims to utilize MBA techniques such as Association Rule Mining and Apriori Algorithm to uncover purchasing patterns, optimize inventory management, and enhance decision-making for retailers.

### 1.2 Scope and Background
By analyzing transactional data and applying MBA techniques, this project seeks to identify frequently bought items, understand item associations, and provide actionable insights for retailers to improve sales strategies, inventory planning, and product placement.
